, shows off ValveÂ´s proprietary technology, including 16-bit color, colored lightning and amazing advances in character movement
- all without the benefit of hardware accelerators. Half-Life also incorporates technology licensed from 
<a href="" style="color: red;">id Software</a> </h3>

<h1>Half-Life</h1>
<h3>excerpt from the official <a href="" style="color: red;">press release:</a>  </h3>
<h3>
    Half-Life introduces a revolutionary leap in the 3D first-person gaming genre by combining stunning technology
    enhancements with genre-breaking gameplay elements. Gamers are given opportunities to wreak havoc--in true
    action-game fashion--but they are also challenged to explore and strategize; for instance , telling 
friend from foe is no longer a simple matter of humans vs. monsters.</h3>
<h3> Check out <a href="" style="color: red;">the official Half-Life site,</a>
where you will be able to find the latest info about the game.
